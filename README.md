The ML project uses the vision transformer algorithm to diagnose breast cancer cases.
Breast cancer is a common type of cancer that affects women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment and recovery. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been used to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer. One such algorithm is the Vision Transformer (ViT), which has been shown to be effective in image classification tasks. This ML project uses the ViT algorithm to diagnose breast cancer cases by analyzing mammogram images. The ViT model is trained on a large dataset of mammogram images with corresponding labels indicating whether the image contains cancerous tissue or not. The trained model can then be used to classify new mammogram images as cancerous or non-cancerous. The results show that the ViT algorithm has high accuracy in detecting breast cancer and has the potential to improve early detection rates. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms, particularly the ViT algorithm, in assisting medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.
